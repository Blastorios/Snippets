Apply a fourier transform and more data preparation methods as you see fit to eventually perform unsupervised clustering in order to look for patterns in music styles that will lead from the last place towards the first place on the list. (Possible Extension) Eventually being able to create a GAN that is capable of producing a unique top 100 song that actually rocks :)."

For example: When the RLM just starts, we start with an empty neuron that will contain a set of values (weights) at a certain intensity (bias). When the agent performs a given task, the state changed and this is remembered dynamically within a neuron's state (state-matching). Following, similar events will alter the same neuron but in the form of a neuronal circuit (aka increase complexity by creating growth). Any new event type will then be decoupled and created independently within an identical form."
