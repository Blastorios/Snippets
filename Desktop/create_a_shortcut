To create a desktop shortcut for an easy-to-use interface, type something like the following into a *.desktop file and store it under ~/Desktop:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Canvas
Comment=Canvas Dashboard
Exec=firefox https://canvas.vu.nl/
Icon=/home/jordi/Desktop/.icons/canvas-logo-icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Web;
```

---

For other applications, like VSCode, simply create a normal file and add the `shebang` line to the file and add `chmod +x filename` to allow execution.
